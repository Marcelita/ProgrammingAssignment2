··Lexical Scoping

··I first run the functions on my computer(bad idea), the computer Never finished its computations. 
Found the warning message in the forum later. 

··By using the functions "PatricK" posted in the forum, I really understood how the <<- operator works.
It assigned the value we provided and set the value in 6, but in the computer  When a function from 
that environment is called to return a value, that function first looks in the local environment 
(where it was called) and then, when the value is not found, it looks in the environment
where it was created, and therefore then finds the values which were assigned with.
